## Final strategy

Each image is independently analyzed by a vision-capable model using a strict
structured schema. Deterministic Python modules then apply evidence requirements,
history-only risk flags, and final decisions. Images remain the primary source of
truth; user history never changes a visual decision.

> **Environment note:** this measured run had no usable vision backend.
> Every model call followed the conservative failure path. The metrics below
> therefore validate schema, orchestration, claim extraction, and error handling;
> they are not representative of the configured vision strategy. Re-run with
> the configured Hugging Face model downloaded, or set
> `VISION_BACKEND=ollama` with Ollama running, or set
> `VISION_BACKEND=openai` with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, before submission.


## Sample metrics

| Field | Exact accuracy |
|---|---:|
| `evidence_standard_met` | 10.0% |
| `risk_flags` | 5.0% |
| `issue_type` | 15.0% |
| `object_part` | 85.0% |
| `claim_status` | 10.0% |
| `supporting_image_ids` | 10.0% |
| `valid_image` | 10.0% |
| `severity` | 10.0% |

Full structured-row accuracy: **0.0%**

Risk flag set F1: **25.5%**

Supporting-image set F1: **10.0%**

### Claim-status accuracy by object

| Object | Accuracy |
|---|---:|
| car | 12.5% |
| laptop | 0.0% |
| package | 16.7% |

## Strategy comparison

1. **Rules-only fallback:** multilingual dictionaries extract claims and technical
   checks detect unreadable images, but rules cannot reliably perceive semantic damage.
2. **Vision observations + deterministic policy (selected):** the model performs
   perception; code controls evidence, risk, decisions, enums, and serialization.

## Operational analysis

- Claims processed: 20
- Images processed: 29
- Approximate model calls: 29
- Cache hits: 0
- Input tokens: 0
- Output tokens: 0
- Approximate cost: **$0.0000**
- Runtime: 30.68 seconds
- Vision backend: `ollama`
- Model: `qwen2.5vl:7b`

For the current default Hugging Face backend, cost is zero after the model is downloaded.
Images are resized before analysis and cached by bytes, claim, backend, model,
and prompt version. Sequential processing stays conservative and reproducible.

## Failure behavior

Unreadable images and exhausted API retries are isolated. The affected claim is
emitted conservatively as `not_enough_information` with
`manual_review_required`. Every row is schema-validated before writing.
